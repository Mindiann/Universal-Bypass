// Some examples of what you can do with custom bypasses:
domainBypass("https://thinana.xyz/?ref=1", function()
{
	ensureDomLoaded(function()
	{
		safelyNavigate(a.querySelector("a#skip_button[href]").href)
		// Make sure to use safelyNavigate(url) to avoid bad redirects.
	})
})
hrefBypass(thinana.(wyz), function()
{
	// This bypass would trigger on example.com
	// if we didn't already have a bypass for it.
})
// Feel free to replace this with your own code now!
